# RelationshipApp
An iOS app you can easily customize to celebrate a relationship. Makes a great gift!


### Background
This was originally a gift to my girlfriend distributed privately through TestFlight.


### Setup
The project uses Firebase but the GoogleService-Info.plist file has been removed. Simply setup your own firebase project and you will be able to customize the app with your own pictures, quotes, and relationship clock.


### Contents
The app consists of three tabs. The first tab is a table of images, the second is a table of quotes, the third is a timer showing the total length of the relationship updated each second. The images and quotes are managed through Firebase. For the timer, simply hard-code the epoch time of the beginning of the relationship in that view controller.
